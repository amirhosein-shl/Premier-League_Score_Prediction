# Premier League Match Score Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting Premier League match scores using machine learning algorithms. The data for this project was obtained from Kaggle's Premier League dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaeemnalla/premier-league). The goal is to develop models that accurately predict match scores based on various features representing both attacking and defensive aspects of each team.

## Data Preparation

1. **Data Source**: The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle and consists of Premier League match results and team statistics for the seasons spanning from 2006 to 2016-2017.

2. **Missing Data Handling**: Missing data in the team statistics was filled using the average values of the same feature across all seasons for the respective teams. This approach ensures that the dataset remains informative while handling missing values effectively.

3. **Feature Selection**: A variety of features representing the attacking and defensive prowess of each team were included in the analysis. These features include goals scored, shots on target, goals conceded, total passes, and clean sheets, among others.

4. **Team Labeling**: Each team was assigned a unique label for identification purposes. A dictionary mapping each team to its corresponding label was created for reference.

5. **One-Hot Encoding**: Seasonal data was one-hot encoded to account for the potential impact of different seasons on match outcomes. This allows the models to capture any seasonal trends that may influence match scores.

## Model Development and Evaluation

1. **Cross-Validation**: K-fold cross-validation was employed to assess the performance of various machine learning models. This technique helps in evaluating the models' generalization ability and selecting the best-performing algorithm.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search with cross-validation was utilized to tune the hyperparameters of each model. This process involves systematically testing different combinations of hyperparameters to identify the optimal configuration for each algorithm.

3. **Model Comparison**: Several machine learning algorithms were evaluated, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Naive Bayes. The performance of each model was compared based on mean squared error (MSE) scores obtained through cross-validation.

4. **Neural Network Experimentation**: A neural network architecture was designed and trained using TensorFlow and Keras. The model's performance was evaluated on a separate test set, and the mean squared error was calculated to assess its predictive accuracy.

5. **Model Persistence**: The best-performing models for predicting home team and away team scores were saved using the pickle library. This allows for easy integration of the trained models into production environments for real-time score prediction.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning techniques to predict Premier League match scores. By leveraging historical match data and team statistics, the developed models offer valuable insights into the factors influencing match outcomes. Further refinements and enhancements to the models can be explored to improve prediction accuracy and robustness.
